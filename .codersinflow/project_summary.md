# Project Summary

## Main Purpose

- The project is a **6502 microprocessor emulator** implemented in the Nim programming language.
- The goal is to develop a high-quality emulator core that accurately implements the 6502 instruction set.
- The development approach follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.
- The project involves systematic implementation of each 6502 opcode, with comprehensive unit and integration testing.
- The emulator is designed to be modular, maintainable, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) / KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) compliant.

---

## Technology Stack and Frameworks

- **Programming Language:** Nim
- **Build and Package Manager:** Nimble
- **Testing Framework:** `testament` (Nim's testing framework)
- **Development Environment:** Uses a devcontainer based on Ubuntu Jammy (`mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:jammy`) with Nim and LLVM installed.
- **Editor Extensions:** Nim language support and debugging extensions for VSCode.
- **Testing Execution:** Tests are run via `nimble test`, which triggers `testament all`.

---

## Framework Versions

- No explicit versions of frameworks like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React, or similar are present or applicable; this is a Nim-based emulator project.
- The devcontainer uses Ubuntu Jammy base image and installs Nim and LLVM via asdf or similar.
- The testing framework used is `testament`, included as a development dependency in `emu6502.nimble`.
- No web frameworks or frontend technologies are involved.

---

## Main Components and Modules

- **src/cpu.nim:** CPU execution logic, including the main execution loop and opcode dispatch.
- **src/opcodes.nim:** Implementation of 6502 opcode handlers.
- **src/addressing.nim:** Addressing mode resolution logic for instructions.
- **src/flags.nim:** CPU flag manipulation utilities.
- **src/stack.nim:** Stack operations.
- **src/types.nim:** Core type definitions, including exceptions like `UnimplementedOpcodeError`.
- **src/opcode_utils.nim:** (Planned/implemented) Helper functions extracted from opcode handlers to reduce duplication.
- **tests/** directory structured as:
  - `tests/integration/`: Integration tests (e.g., running `helloworld`, `bf6502` programs).
  - `tests/unit/`: Unit tests for CPU, memory, opcode handlers.
  - `tests/fixtures/`: Setup and teardown helpers.

---

## Project Structure

- `.roo/` directory:
  - Contains tracking files for opcode implementation status (`opcode_XX.roo`).
  - Contains documentation and plans for opcode implementation and refactoring.
- `tests/` directory:
  - Organized into integration, unit, and fixture subdirectories.
- `src/` directory:
  - Contains the core emulator source code modules.
- `.devcontainer/`:
  - Contains devcontainer configuration for consistent development environment.
- `.vscode/`:
  - Contains VSCode tasks configuration for building and debugging Nim files.
- `emu6502.nimble`:
  - Nimble package configuration file specifying dependencies and tasks.

---

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive 6502 Instruction Set Emulation:**
  - Implementation of all 256 opcodes, with handlers for each addressing mode.
  - Refactoring ongoing to consolidate opcode handlers into generic handlers per mnemonic to reduce code duplication.
- **Test-Driven Development:**
  - Each opcode is implemented with accompanying unit tests.
  - Integration tests verify correct execution of assembled programs (e.g., `helloworld`).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Custom exception `UnimplementedOpcodeError` is raised when unimplemented opcodes are encountered.
- **Continuous Refactoring:**
  - Plans and ongoing work to modularize opcode handlers into thematic modules (logical, data transfer, shift/rotate, branching).
  - Helper functions are extracted into utility modules.
- **CI and Testing:**
  - Tests run via `nimble test` using `testament`.
  - Clear reporting of test results.
- **Code Quality:**
  - Emphasis on DRY and KISS principles.
  - Semantic git commits and iterative development process.
- **Emulator Behavior:**
  - Accurate cycle counting including page crossing penalties.
  - Correct flag updates according to opcode semantics.
  - Stack and memory operations implemented per 6502 specification.

---

## Development and Refactoring Workflow

- The project uses a **master orchestration workflow** to track opcode implementation progress via `.roo/opcode_XX.roo` files.
- Two main workflows:
  1. **Iterative TDD Implementation:** Implement opcodes one-by-one with tests.
  2. **Code Refactoring:** Identify large source files (e.g., `src/opcodes.nim`) and apply DRY/KISS refactorings.
- Refactoring steps include:
  - Baseline test confirmation.
  - Extraction of helper functions.
  - Modularization of opcode handlers into logical groups.
  - Removal of legacy or redundant code.
  - Updating opcode dispatch tables to use new modular handlers.
- Each refactoring step is followed by running the full test suite and committing changes with semantic messages.

## Summary

This project is a **Nim-based 6502 CPU emulator** focused on correctness, maintainability, and test coverage. It leverages Nim's `testament` framework for testing and uses a well-structured development process with incremental implementation and refactoring. The codebase is modularized into CPU logic, opcode handlers, addressing modes, and utility modules. Testing includes unit and integration levels, ensuring reliable emulation of the 6502 microprocessor.

No web frameworks or frontend technologies (like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React) are part of this project, so no versions for those frameworks are applicable or available.
